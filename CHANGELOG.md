# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.6] - 2023-09-21
- Built for Minecraft 1.20.2

## [2.0.5] - 2023-06-13
- Built for Minecraft 1.20.1

## [2.0.4] - 2023-06-08
- Built for Minecraft 1.20

## [2.0.3] - 2023-04-06
- Vanilla parity: When falling down after rail on a cliff the behaviour is now vanilla, that means you can now fall down from a cliff to a perpendicular rail track.
- A little more slowdown before descending rails. Due to the vanilla parity you now start descending with 8m/s instead of 9.2m/s
- A little more slowdown before detector / activator rails. On and directly before detector/activator rails you also move with 8m/s instead of 9.2m/s now. 
- Mod Compatibility: We only overwrite the moveOnRail function now when there is actually a LivingEntity riding the cart
- (technical) Mixin is targeting AbstractMinecartEntity again so we can inject and cancel the overwrite
- Built for Minecraft 1.19.4

## [2.0.2] - 2023-03-15
- Starting with this version only mc 1.19+ receives mod updates (2.0.1 is very stable for mc 1.18 and 1.17)
- (technical) Refactored mixin to target MinecartEntity directly instead of AbstractMinecartEntity, therefore potentially increasing compatibility to other mods even more
- Built for Minecraft 1.19.4

## [2.0.1] - 2023-02-20
- Enhance compatibility for redstone chest/hopper minecart constructions (They are 100% vanilla now. The hook was changed to only apply to rideable minecarts)

## [2.0.0] - 2022-09-25
- Refactor infra to support multiple MC versions

## [1.0.2] - 2022-01-06
- Increase compatibility to other mods

## [1.0.1] - 2021-08-25
- Fix acceleration behaviour for passengerless minecarts

## [1.0.0] - 2021-08-25
- Fixed a long-standing vanilla bug that doubles the Cart Movement Speed when a block is skipped in a tick
- Raised maximum speed from 8m/s to 34m/s for carts with passengers (achievable when there are 8 straight rail
  pieces behind and in front of the cart)
- Raised fallback maximum speed from 8m/s to 9.2m/s for carts with passengers
- Tweaked powered rail acceleration to factor in fewer spent ticks on higher speeds and multiply the acceleration accordingly
- Tweaked acceleration to be require more powered rails on higher speeds
- Tweaked acceleration to feel good and somewhat train-y.
- Tweaked achievable momentum for the new high-speed
- Tweaked breaks to handle the higher speed and momentum properly
- Tweaked "kick-start" speed when starting from a standing block with a powered rail
- Cart Engine simulates travel along the railway and dynamically adjusts allowed speed based on rail conditions around the cart
- High-Speed Cart temporarily slows down for slopes and curves
- High-Speed Cart temporarily slows down for Detector Rails and Activator Rails
